Start by clarifying what the system should do. A typical LMS should support:

Users: Students, Librarians

Books: Add, remove, search

Issue/Return books: Track due dates, fines

Reservations: For already-issued books

Notifications: Reminders for due/overdue

Fine Calculation: Based on return delay
